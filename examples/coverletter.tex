\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I have been working as a software engineer for over seven years, and almost every opportunity I have had somehow involved C\# and the .NET platform. Whether it was simulating embedded devices, providing consulting services as a Microsoft Gold partner, or founding a company, I always ended up needing Microsoft technologies to get the job done. It's been incredible watching the .NET platform evolve and C\# become a more versatile language, and I would be honored to be of service to others by making Azure's Compute offerings reach new milestones.

\lettersection{Why Microsoft?}
I have been using C\# and F\# for a number of years, and both have been an absolute pleasure to work with. It has been inspiring watching Microsoft grow into one of the largest open-source contributors and open up millions of lines of code, and as someone who holds the free and open exchange of knowledge as one of his greatest values in life, it provides an opportunity to work somewhere that is in alignment with my values, which is not always easy to find. Microsoft has also employed many of my programming heroes at one time or another: Eric Lippert, Scott Hanselman, Don Syme, Julie Lerman, and many others.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
Writing software and creating systems has become my greatest passion in life. That passion was developed working across a wide range of industries, with clients and employers of all sizes, and gaining new perspectives with each step of my journey. I am a fast learner, which allows me to take on whatever responsibilities are required to help my team progress during a Sprint. With my recent interest in DevOps and knowledge of networking, I believe that I can contribute greatly to Microsoft's vision for Azure.
