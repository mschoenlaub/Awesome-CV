\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I started out my career working on devices for the traffic and transportation industry. We didn't know it at the time, or at least we didn't call it that, but we were producing some of the first IoT devices. I've been able to work on many exciting projects throughout my career, but I often miss those days. I loved writing code at such a low level of abstraction and the level of detail required to become proficient at the craft. I've been waiting for a chance to return to that world, and it looks like I found it!

\lettersection{Why EY?}
IoT is the future, whether we like it or not. It has the potential to do amazing things for us: Smart Cities transformed to optimize energy usage, reduce our carbon footprint, manage traffic more effectively, deliver more consistent high-speed wireless connectivity, change the way we conduct business transactions...the potential is limitless. I have also heard analysts warn that it could be "the asbestos of our time" if inadequate security, poor understanding of the market, failure to find universal protocols, or vendor lock-in leave us trying to dismantle every IoT device in ten years before they can do more harm. I believe EY has the resources to direct us towards an ideal vision of the future instead of a technological dystopia.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
One-third of the space of my desk is reserved for microcontrollers that I am currently experimenting with. Right now, it's an Azure Sphere developer's kit, a MicroChip SAMC21 and a SparkFun Redboard Artemis. I have a working knowledge of most of the technologies that I will need to succeed in this position. I will admit what I know and what I don't know, and I will go about fixing any knowledge gaps as quickly as I can. I have experience writing and integrating with APIs, a thorough understanding of network technologies, and an eye for cybersecurity. Consulting is familiar territory, and I believe my experience mentoring other developers leaves me ready to humbly lead others. Let's make sure IoT is remembered as a masterpiece of digital transformation, and not a giant waste of silicon.
