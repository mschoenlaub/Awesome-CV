\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I've spent the last 7 years making the .NET Platform as diverse of an experience as it could possibly be...I started out working with embedded systems in the traffic industry, did plenty of work with CMS systems, founded a startup that didn't quite make it off the ground, and was lucky enough to have some brilliant mentors. Lately, I've been focusing on DevOps and Linux Systems Administration to expand my horizons. I've been learning Elixir and Ruby and trying to contribute to some open-source projects.

\lettersection{Why Twitter?}
I find it a little entertaining that within a week of me finally deciding to make a Twitter account, I get to go from begging our President to send Navy ships to Australia to aid evacuations to applying for a job. I was told that you should never be the smartest person at your workplace, and at Twitter, I know there will be many engineers who are smarter than me, and I can find a mentor to grow and exchange ideas with an incredibly diverse team. I want to be challenged, and I can see the Platform Engineering team being the perfect place for my newfound interest in DevOps to blossom.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
It does seem a little strange, doesn't it? Twitter's tools of choice are Java, C/C++, and Scala; I have moderate experience with one of those languages. But software languages can be picked up quickly, especially when you are being challenged. By comparing what I learn to all of the concepts I am already familiar with, I can make connections quickly and start delivering results immediately. I hope my background will let me share different perspectives with my team, and that we can all grow together through our collective knowledge and lives.
