\lettersection{About Me}
I started out my career working on devices for the traffic and transportation industry. We didn't know it at the time, or at least we didn't call it that, but we were producing some of the first IoT devices. I've been able to work on many exciting projects throughout my career, but I often miss those days. I loved writing code at such a low level of abstraction and the level of detail required to become proficient at the craft. I've been waiting for a chance to return to that world, and it looks like I found it!

\lettersection{Why TEKsystems?}
It's not everyday that you come across opportunities to be a part of a team which is enabling the future...ten years ago who would have guessed that we are automating automated factories with small cross-functional teams? I've been searching for a chance to get back to the IoT industry in some fashion and this is it!

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have the Javascript skills of a ninja - especially if TypeScript is allowed! Strong typing or not, I take software craftsmanship very seriously and have been striving to become a better developer every day. I can remember reading "Javascript, the Good Parts" for the very first time and finally being able to write programs without JavaScript gotchas catching my by surprise. I learned Express in order to co-found a startup and have been working with NodeJS ever since. We also used AWS for our venture, so I have experience deploying, managing and troubleshooting cloud resources. I have always been the go-to person for data integrations of any type at past employers, and I have a thorough understanding of REST and GraphQL principles. I also know Vue already, so no need to even train me!
