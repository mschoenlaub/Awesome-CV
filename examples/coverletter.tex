\lettersection{About Me}
I started out my career working on devices for the traffic and transportation industry. We didn't know it at the time, or at least we didn't call it that, but we were producing some of the first IoT devices. I've been able to work on many exciting projects throughout my career, but I often miss those days. I loved writing code at such a low level of abstraction and the level of detail required to become proficient at the craft. I have more microcontrollers than I can count off the top of my head which I still love to play around with, trying to find the next big idea and make something which can transform our world into a better place.

\lettersection{Why Cox Enterprises?}
It's not often that I come across IOT jobs where I possess all of the required qualifications. Many companies still have a very old school attitude where the conversation stops when you mention not having an Electrical Engineering degree. 32-bit microcontrollers really changed the industry, and IoT development is no longer about bit twiddling on 8-bit chips with a compiler which isn't quite standard C. Today, Edge computing remains one of the biggest challenges and one of the most lucrative business opportunities, and Cox has the infrastructure to gain a competitive edge in the arena while other companies negotiate to accumulate dark fiber or work out municipal wireless systems. You are providing me an opportunity to work in my ideal role, and you will not be disappointed with the results!

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I possess a thorough understanding of networking technology and information security, courtesy of many years of consulting which enabled me to work as a backend developer. I have plenty of experience writing quality, modern JavaScript code, and have some knowledge of Python gained while learning more about DevOps. I have always been impressed with the capabilities of PostgreSQL and use it on every project I can, and it is one of many Linux server components I am comfortable working with. I have been learning how to automate systems administration tasks with Salt and Chef, and I have experience with AWS, Azure, Docker and Jenkins. My past startup venture was an alerting company which used SMS to dispatch volunteer firefighters in Australia, a service I was grateful we could provide and which forced me to learn more than I expected about telecommunications systems and reverse engineering! I look good on paper, but I sound even better in person. I look forward to hearing from you soon about how we can work together to create the infrastructure of the future!
