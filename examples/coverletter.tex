\lettersection{About Me}
A few months ago, I was standing in a liquor store in Auckland, New Zealand talking to the shop's proprietor after he noticed my Georgia Tech hat. His brother had come to America to study at Tech, and I mentioned what a great place Atlanta was. He smiled and asked me why I wasn't on the West coast. I was a bit perplexed until he explained that his brother moved to California and is happier than he has ever been in his life. I'm beginning to see why; in past job hunts I was too afraid to leave the comfort of my hometown, but I keep encountering companies that remind me of New Zealand. Everyone was more authentic and people were very focused when they engaged you in casual conversation, as if they had nowhere else to be and making the most of the present moment was all that mattered. I spent a lot of time reflecting on life during that trip, and decided that I needed to change up my life. I've enjoyed being a full-stack C\# developer for the past 7 years, but DevOps and SRE have always fascinated me, so I sacrificed a lot of things in life to study those subjects for a few months.

\lettersection{Why LightStep?}
Today, I discovered keyvalues.com, a site which tries to match you with companies that share your value system. We were matched based upon a mutual respect for coding as a craft, fostering a high degree of trust between coworkers, finding strength in diversity, and a heavy emphasis on teamwork. For a brief period in my life, I was an Emergency Medical Technician. It was a very demanding job and very difficult for an empathetic person to witness night after night. But I still remember some of the more intense calls we responded to, where there was an element of focus and grace in the midst of chaos and terror that we barely had to speak to coordinate our actions. I've never felt such a strong team bond, and I'd like to work with people who respect the power of teamwork. Your "About Me" page sums things up perfectly...we have a moral responsibility to ensure that the rapid transformation within our industry is not taken for granted. Systems are more complex than ever, and we have an opportunity to help people prepare for that complexity, so that they can enjoy work/life balance and not spend weeks at a time "putting out fires."

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have a non-traditional background in Computer Science. I attribute a lot of my knowledge to the fact that I simply said yes anytime I was asked to help out with something. I was exposed to new concepts, new patterns and practices, and new philosophies on how to build software effectively. When I volunteered to write environment setup runbooks, there wasn't anyone else rushing to put their hand up. It taught me a lot about networking and servers, however. And a few years later, I find myself taking over DevOps on a project when our DevOps architect had to step down due to budget. I still have a lot to learn, but I love everything I've learned so far and intend to keep learning whatever it takes to succeed at Software and Reliability Engineering. I've worked with marketing teams, front-end teams, and back-end teams, so I empathize with everyone's challenges and would be grateful for the chance to make their lives easier.
